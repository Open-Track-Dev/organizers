FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial conference series organised by the community for the community. The aim is to
provide a place for free and open source software developers and communities to meet.
The first meeting for developers of open source software, called ‘Open Source Developers’ European Meeting’ (OSDEM),
took place in 2000. In its second year, OSDEM was renamed FOSDEM.
The videos published on the TIB AV-Portal are mainly materials presented at the annual FOSDEM, which aims to promote the
widespread use of free and open source software.
